        <h1>Who am I</h1>
<p>I am a student at SČMSD Humpolec school and I strive to create websites. Although I don't have a lot of knowledge, I'm constantly trying to learn more and more to improve my work. I enjoy creating websites using HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP. I'm always looking for different ways to enhance my work and I would love to participate in web development projects for anyone and continue to progress.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Certificates</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I haven't had many opportunities to get involved, but I have some certificates that represent a part of my knowledge in this field.</p>
